Market Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project focuses on implementing K-Means clustering to perform market segmentation on a dataset containing customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their behaviors and preferences, enabling more targeted marketing strategies.
Key steps in this project include:
1.	Data Standardization: To ensure fair clustering, the data was standardized to eliminate biases arising from differences in scales.
2.	Optimal Cluster Selection: The Elbow Method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters by analyzing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and identifying the point where adding more clusters provided diminishing returns.
3.	Clustering Analysis: The K-Means algorithm was applied to group customers into clusters based on their satisfaction and loyalty measures.
The results offer valuable insights into customer segmentation, providing actionable recommendations for improving customer experience and tailoring marketing strategies to specific segments.
